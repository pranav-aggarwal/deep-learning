ML session-2
	Recap of ML

		Types pf learning:
			Supervised -> make predictions
				regression -> predict cont. numeric values like temp, salary, age, weight, loan amount etc.
						Linear regression
						Tree based
							Decision trees
							Random forest
						SVM
				classification -> predict categorical values which can be either binary or multi-class
					Tree based
							Decision trees
							Random forest
					Logistic regression
					SVM
				SL - Train the model using both the features + target(column to be predicted)
			USL - no predictions here hence no target. get some insights about data
					clusters
						k-means
						hierarchical
					recommendation(not in scope)
						content based filtering
						colloborative filtering
			Linear regression:
					simple linear -> one feature
					multi-variate or multiple linear regression - multiple feature
				Assumption : linear relationship exists between features and target
				tries to fit a best fit line for all the data points
				best fit line is a line with minimal deveation
				deveation is represented as MSE or RMSE
				only the best fit line with result in the least possible RMSE
				Preformance of a regression R2 score -> measures the varience exhibited by the model with refrence to the varience in the underlying data
		library used for ML in sklearn:
			EDA
				understanding data
				data cleaning
				obtaining visuals
				dropping out certain features
				....
			pre-process the data(optional)
				scaling of data
				encoding string categorical columns
			Seperate out the features and the target
			split the data into train and test
			train the model (use both the features and the target of the training set)
			Make predictions(use only the features of the test set)
			evaluate the preformance(compare the predicted results with the actual test values of the target column)
